<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install ```Node.js``` (version 19 or higher) before proceeding. <br />
   Ensure you have a codebase ready to index.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Graptor on your codebase:

**Step 1**: Install Graptor:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i graptor
  ```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the codebase folder or specific directory:

```bash
graptor run <folder name>
```

Graptor internally Parses your code with ASTs and Builds a semantic code graph.

At this point, **code-graph.json** is created. You can stop here if you only need the code graph.

**Step 3**: Generate vector embeddings:

Do you want to embed these chunks into vectors now? (Y/n)

If you choose **Yes**, you can select:

- **Open-source model** (default, no API key needed)  
- **Your own model** (coming soon!)

Graptor then converts each code chunk into a **vector embedding** and saves the 
result in **embeddigs.json**

Now, These embeddings are ready to use in a vector database or with LLM agents.
