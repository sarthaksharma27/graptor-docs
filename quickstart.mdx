<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install ```Node.js``` (version 19 or higher) before proceeding. <br />
   Ensure you have a codebase ready to index.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Graptor on your codebase:

**Step 1**: Install Graptor:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i graptor
  ```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the codebase folder or specific directory:

```bash
graptor run <folder name>
```

After running Graptor, you’ll find a .graptor folder inside your project directory containing:

**code-graph.json** – internal representation of your codebase as a structured semantic graph.

**embeddings.json** – vector embeddings of your code chunks, ready to be stored in a vector database or consumed by AI agents.
