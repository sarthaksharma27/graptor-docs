### Why Graptor?

Dharma, a senior engineer at Meta [Read full blog on Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/blog/100-devs)

> _I have to touch cross-language repos. One part of the code will be in PHP, and another
in Python or C++, and switching between each and seeing how they interact makes it harder
to finish the features._

Modern codebases are too large and dynamic to understand manually.
Tools like Cursor use LLMs to help but they all need one key thing


A structured understanding of your codebase.

Graptor is an open source engine that gives you just that. It reads your entire project and extracts a **semantic code graph**. For Example:

- Function declarations
- Who calls who

Graptor gives you clean, structured JSON that represents your entire codebase as a
semantic graph.
A machine readable graph that you can feed into whatever you want.


### What Can You Build With It?

- Query your code: "Where is this function used?"
- Visualize dependencies across your repo
- Embed graph in a vector database + run LLM agents
- Build your own Greptile/Cursor-like tool, powered by real structure

Grapho is the missing link between static code and intelligent dev tools.

### Supported Languages

Graptor currently supports JavaScript, TypeScript, out of the box.
We're actively working on adding support for all major languages
