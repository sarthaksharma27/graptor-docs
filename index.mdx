Graptor turns your entire repository into a structured, vectorized representation giving LLMs
the context they need to reason about your code without hallucination.

### Why Graptor?

Dharma, a senior engineer at Meta [Read full blog on Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/blog/100-devs)

> _I have to touch cross-language repos. One part of the code will be in PHP, and another
in Python or C++, and switching between each and seeing how they interact makes it harder
to finish the features._

Modern codebases are too large and dynamic to understand manually.
Tools like Cursor use LLMs to help but they all need one key thing:

A structured understanding of your codebase.

Graptor is an open source engine that gives you just that. It reads your entire project, builds 
a semantic code graph, and then transforms that structure into vector embeddings — the universal 
language models can understand.

For example, Graptor captures:

- Function declarations
- Who calls who

The result: a vectorized representation of your codebase a machine readable map that can power
any intelligent tooling you build on top of it.


### What Can You Build With It?

- LLM-powered code queries – build tools that can answer questions like “Where is this function used?"
- Dependency visualization – generate structured data to map how modules and functions interact across your repo.
- AI-native indexing – Embed your code graph into a vector database and run LLM agents on top.
- Build your own Greptile or Cursor-like tool – powered by real structural understanding, not fuzzy pattern matching.

Graptor is the missing link between static code and intelligent developer tools.

### Supported Languages

Graptor currently supports JavaScript, TypeScript, out of the box.
We're actively working on adding support for all major languages
